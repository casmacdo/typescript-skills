# Basics

TypeScript is a JavaScript derivitive designed to reduce type errors. These errors were common problems in larger-scale JavaScript implimentations. Mismatched data types create type errors. For example, a function could expect a string and recieve an integer. Before running our code, the Typescript compiler ensures that the program's types are correct.
